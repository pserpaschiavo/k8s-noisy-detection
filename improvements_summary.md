# Improvements to the Causal Analysis Module

## Fixing Deprecated Pandas Methods
- Replaced the deprecated `DataFrame.append()` method with the recommended approach of accumulating results in a list of dictionaries and then creating a DataFrame once.

## Enhanced Error Handling
- Added comprehensive try-except blocks to catch and log errors at appropriate levels
- Added input validation for function parameters
- Added boundary checking for array indices and window operations
- Added checks for empty or insufficient data
- Added proper handling of NaN values throughout the code

## Improved Robustness
- Enhanced the change point detection with better checks for valid points
- Added additional validation in the `_calculate_impact_strength` function:
  - Better handling of series with high NaN percentages
  - Safe division with small denominator values
  - Clear logging of components that contribute to high impact scores
- Improved the `_calculate_window_correlation` function:
  - Added handling for series of different lengths
  - Better handling of NaN values before correlation calculation
  - Checks for sufficient variance in the data
  - Detection and handling of invalid correlation values

## Code Quality
- Added more detailed logging for debugging and analysis
- Improved exception handling by adding specific exception types
- Added inline documentation for complex calculations
- Added tracking of key failure points for future analysis

These improvements make the causal analysis module more robust and reliable, especially when dealing with real-world noisy data from Kubernetes environments where metrics can have various quality issues.
